<h3> Technical Skills</h3>
<p> JAVA, C++, C, HTML, PHP, CSS, SQL, Python
</p>

<h3>Academic Projects :</h3>

<p><b>Image Classifier using Tensorflow (Deep Learning)</b><p>
<p>For   this   image   classifier,  I have used the model trained on the ImageNet Large Visual Recognition Challenge dataset. These models can differentiate between 1,000 different classes, like Dalmatian, dishwasher etc.
By using this classifier we can classify any image by training the model using the dataset of the image to be classified.(Python, tensorflow)
</p>

<p><b> Music Library Management</b><p>
<p>This is website created by me in which userâ€™s from different background can search the music of his/her taste as per the name of the artist, album, genre, rating, popularity, date of release in market, most played.
 It has a special feature of searching the music by mood of the user and user can also comment on the content of the website for improvements or complaints. (HTML, PHP, CSS, SQL)

<p><b>A Computer Search

Engine Retrieval

System Using Map-
Reduce Clustering

Algorithm.</b><p> 
<p>The system gives implementation of data clustering using

map-reduce algorithm. In this system the input may be

any kind of data such as our computer hard disk, data in

the mobile, external hard disk etc. and output will be

clustered data. A Map-Reduce program is proposed of a

Map( ) procedure that performs filtering and sorting and

Reduce( ) procedure which performs a summary operation.

This system will provide security to clustered data stored

on the computer through encryption and also provides fast

retrieval of data. (Java, SQL)
</p>

<p><b>Payroll System</b></p>
<p>The implemented system helps to generate the salary of

an employee working for an industry each month and

contains a feature that take care of the attendance of

the employees working in a industry. It keeps a track of

employee attendance and on that basis it generates the

monthly salary of an employee. It also helps to generate

pay slip as well as summary of the payroll. During the

calculation of the salary it also considers the tax's to be

paid by the employee, provident fund and other allowances

that should be given to the employee. The implemented

system helps us to eradicate many issues regarding

manual work and get the quick end results without any

errors.  (Java, SQL) </p>

<p><b>Quiz competition</b></p>
<p>Implemented system helps us to take test for the students

in an efficient manner. The main objective of quiz was to

efficiently evaluate the candidate thoroughly through a

fully automated system that not only saves lot of time but

also gives fast results. For students the advantage was

that they can give papers according to their convenience

and time and there is no need of using extra things like

paper, pen, pencil etc. (C++, SQL)</p>
<p><b>Inventory

Management</b></p>
<p>Inventory management is a system that tells us about the

stock of physical goods that contain economic value. The

record of the physical goods is divided into different

types INPUT(e.g:-raw materials), PROCESS(work in

progress), OUTPUT(finished goods). The main objective of

this system was to determine the health of the supply

chain as well as the impacts of the financial health of the

balance sheet. This system helps the organization to hold

the stock of various physical resources to aid in future

consumption and sale. It also provides the summary of

stock goods in organization. (C)</p>
